Treehouse Techdegree Project 5 - Public API Requests

This project generates a list of 12 employees by sending a fetch() request to the randomuser.me API, then calling the various functions created to aid in the generation of and insertion of the HTML elements, styling thereof, and the activation of various buttons with eventListeners.  Each employee is displayed on an initial card which when clicked opens a Modal window displaying further information about that employee.  

A search feature was installed that filters the employee listings by name.

CSS styling is slightly modified with random background colors for the Modal and Modal buttons being generated while cycling through the list via the "Prev" and "Next" buttons
